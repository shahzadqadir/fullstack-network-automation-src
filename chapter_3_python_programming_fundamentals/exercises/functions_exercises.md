### Functions Exercises

1. Write a function which takes a `name` with a **default set to an empty string**. If the user supplies a name, the function prints `"Hello, xxx"`, where `xxx` is the name provided by the user. If no name is provided, the function just prints `"Hello, World!"`.
2. Write a function that will take a list and return the **sum of all numbers** in the list.
3. Write a function that takes a number and returns its **factorial**.
4. Write a function that takes a number between 1 and 1000 from the user, generates a random number, and checks if the user-supplied number is equal to the randomly generated number. If it is, tell the user they have won. Otherwise, tell the user if their number was too low or too high. The random number generated must also be between 1 and 1000.
5. Write a function called `password_validation`. It must take one parameter called `password`, check if the password user supplied is:
   - at least 8 characters long,
   - does not start with a number,
   - must have at least one number, and
   - must have at least one special character. If all these conditions are met, return `True`; else, return `False`.
