### Chapter 1 - Build Docker Image
Docker container allow us to bundle applications along with their dependencies. In this chapter, we’ll start by creating a Docker image that includes Python and all the necessary libraries for our purposes. We’ll also install Ansible in the same image. Once built, the image will be hosted on Docker Hub (a free Docker repository), providing us with a portable development environment that can run on any machine—Windows, Linux, or Mac—as long as Docker is installed.
